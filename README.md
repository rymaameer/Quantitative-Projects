### Merton-KMV Credit Risk Model
This is a C++ implementation of the Merton-KMV credit risk model. The code uses the Newton-Raphson algorithm to iteratively calculate a firm's distance to default (DTD) and asset volatility, demonstrating a strong understanding of quantitative finance, numerical methods, and risk assessment.
